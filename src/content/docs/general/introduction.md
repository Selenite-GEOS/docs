Welcome to Selenite! Selenite is an initiative to provide geoscientists around the world with a powerful graphical interface for using GEOS, a massively parallelized multiphysic simulation framework.

Selenite consists of two interfaces, Selenite Simple and Selenite Advanced.

Selenite Simple aims to be a simplified interface which aims to make using GEOS as simple as picking a few components and changing a few parameters.

On the other hand, Selenite Advanced aims to provide users with a powerful and limitless way to create GEOS input files using visual programming. 

The two interfaces are connected and can share configuration blocks (macro blocks). For instance, if in Selenite Simple you end up missing a feature, all you have to do is to use Selenite Advanced to create a macro block that will then be available in the simplified interface.
