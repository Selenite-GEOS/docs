**Welcome to _Selenite_!** _Selenite_ is an initiative to provide geoscientists around the world with a powerful graphical interface for using _GEOS_, a massively parallelized multiphysics simulation framework.

## Two interfaces
_Selenite_ consists of two interfaces, _Selenite_ and _Selenite Advanced_.

### Selenite
_Selenite_ (or _Selenite Simple_) aims to be a simplified interface which aims to make using _GEOS_ as simple as picking a few components and changing a few parameters.

### Selenite Advanced
On the other hand, _Selenite Advanced_ aims to provide users with a powerful and limitless way to create GEOS input files using visual programming. 

### Data sharing
The two interfaces are connected and can share configuration blocks (macro blocks). For instance, if in _Selenite Simple_ you end up missing a feature, all you have to do is to use _Selenite Advanced_ to create a macro block that will then be available in the simplified interface.
